[LLM Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp/tree/main) is a free 10-week online course focused on practical applications of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically in the context of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). 

The primary objective is to build a question-answering (Q&A) system using frequently asked questions (FAQs) documents from different courses. This system will help users or students retrieve accurate answers before they resort to asking questions directly in community channels.

- **Implementation and Practical Application**
At the end of the course, students will have developed a functional Q&A system that integrates an LLM with a knowledge base of FAQ documents. This interface will likely be implemented via a simple user interface, such as through Streamlit, allowing easy question input and answer output.
