## Bonus: calculating the costs (ungraded)

Suppose that on average per request we send 150 tokens and receive back 250 tokens.

How much will it cost to run 1000 requests?

You can see the prices [here](https://openai.com/api/pricing/)

On June 17, the prices for gpt4o are:

* Input: $0.005 / 1K tokens
* Output: $0.015 / 1K tokens

You can redo the calculations with the values you got in Q6 and Q7.
